## Abstract

Repeatedly presenting a target within a stable search array facilitates visual search, an effect termed as ¡°contextual cueing¡±. Previous solo-performance studies have shown that successful acquisition of contextual memories requires explicit allocation of attentional resources to the task-relevant repeated contexts. By contrast, repeated, but task-irrelevant contexts could not be learned when presented together with repeated task-relevant contexts due to blocking effect. Here we investigated if such blocking of context learning could be diminished in social context, when the task-irrelevant context is a task-relevant for a co-actor in joint action search mode. We adopted the contextual cueing paradigm and extended to the co-active search mode. Participants learned a context-cued subset of the search displays (color-defined) in the training phase, and their search performance was tested in the transfer phase, where previously irrelevant and relevant subsets were swapped. The experiments were conducted either in a solo search mode (Experiments 1 and 3) or in a co-active search mode (Experiment 2). Consistent with the classical contextual cueing studies, contextual cueing was observed in the training phase of all three experiments. Importantly, however, in the ¡®swapped¡¯ test session a significant contextual cueing effect was manifested only in the co-active search mode, but not in the solo search mode. Our findings suggest that social context may widen the scope of attention, thus facilitating the acquisition of task-irrelevant contexts.
