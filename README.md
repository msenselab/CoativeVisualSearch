## Abstract

Visual search is speeded over time if a target is repeatedly encountered within a stable search array, an effect termed “contextual cueing”. Previous studies with solo-performance have shown that contextual learning requires explicit attentional resources to the task-relevant repeated context, while task-irrelevant repeated context has mostly been ignored. In a collaborative environment, however, people often keep some attention to their own task-irrelevant but collaborative relevant context. Whether contextual learning occurs with those irrelevant contexts remains unsolved. Thus, the current study was designed to examine collaborative contextual cueing. Participants searched for a target among black and white items (color randomized) in the learning phase of the experiment. Crucially, during the transfer session, unknown to participants, the previously irrelevant repeated context became task-relevant. The search was performed either in a solo condition (Experiment 1) or together with a collaborator (Experiment 2). We observed a stable contextual cueing effect in the learning but not transfer phase in the solo Experiment 1. Most interestingly, in the collaborative Experiment 2, the cueing effect was evident in both phases. These results suggest that representations of a coactor's task prompted contextual learning of otherwise irrelevant context, which could be achieved via shared focus of attention between partners. We conclude that the social interaction may widen the scope of attention, thus facilitating the acquisition of task-irrelevant contexts.
